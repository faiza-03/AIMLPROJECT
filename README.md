# AIMLPROJECT
# üçé Apple Quality Prediction

This project aims to predict the quality of apples using various machine learning algorithms. It is a capstone project developed as part of our B.Tech degree in Computer Science and Engineering.

## üìå Objective

To build and evaluate machine learning models that can accurately predict apple quality based on physical and chemical attributes such as:

- Size
- Weight
- Sweetness
- Crunchiness
- Juiciness
- Ripeness
- Acidity

---

## üß† Algorithms Used

The following supervised learning algorithms were implemented and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- AdaBoost (Result mentioned, implementation optional)

---

## üìä Dataset

A labeled dataset containing apple characteristics was used, with the following features:

- `_id`
- `Size`
- `Weight`
- `Sweetness`
- `Crunchiness`
- `Juiciness`
- `Ripeness`
- `Acidity`
- `Quality` (Target variable)

> üìÅ The dataset file should be placed inside a folder named `data/`.

## üß™ Evaluation Metrics

Each model is evaluated using:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1 Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
